# SmartPhone-python
This is a basic smart phone made on python this is my first semester python project


Tkinter-based smartphone application focuses on simplicity with core functions like a feed, search feature, calculator, and stopwatch. The feed likely displays updates or information, providing a central hub for user activity. The search functionality facilitates quick navigation or data retrieval. The calculator is a handy tool for basic arithmetic operations, while the stopwatch serves as a timekeeping utility. This minimalistic approach caters to users who value a straightforward mobile experience with essential tools for information access, calculations, and time management.
